#Bookly: Book Store App.

I’m excited to introduce my latest project, the Bookly App, an advanced reading platform developed with Flutter. This application leverages modern architectural patterns, including MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) and BLoC (Business Logic Component), to deliver a fluid and engaging reading experience. Bookly is a free app where users can browse a vast selection of books, supported by a powerful search tool and preview feature.

The idea for Bookly was inspired by my completion of the Flutter Advanced Course: Bloc and MVVM Pattern [Arabic][2023] on Udemy, led by the renowned instructor Tharwat Samy.

Overview: Bookly prioritizes efficiency and user satisfaction, incorporating MVVM and the BLoC pattern for state management to enable users to easily explore and enjoy a personalized library.

Key Features:

• Splash Screen: An inviting introduction displaying the app’s logo.
• Home Screen: Browse curated book recommendations.
• Book Details Screen: View detailed information for selected books.
• Search Screen: Quickly find books by title, author, or genre.

Technical Highlights:

• MVVM Architecture: Provides maintainable and testable code.
• Error Handling: Features a robust mechanism for smooth performance, including exception handling via DioException.
• Dio: A high-performance HTTP client for seamless API interactions.
• Bloc and Cubit: State management tools that enhance application responsiveness.
• Design Patterns: Implemented to ensure a modular and scalable design.
• Animations: Added to enrich user experience.
