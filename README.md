# 📚 Bookly: Book Store App

## 📜 Overview  
I’m excited to introduce my latest project, the **Bookly App**, an advanced reading platform developed with **Flutter**. This application leverages modern architectural patterns, including **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) and **BLoC** (Business Logic Component), to deliver a fluid and engaging reading experience. **Bookly** is a free app where users can browse a vast selection of books, supported by a powerful search tool and preview feature.

The idea for **Bookly** was inspired by my completion of the **Flutter Advanced Course: Bloc and MVVM Pattern [Arabic][2023]** on Udemy, led by the renowned instructor **Tharwat Samy**.

**Bookly** prioritizes efficiency and user satisfaction, incorporating **MVVM** and the **BLoC** pattern for state management to enable users to easily explore and enjoy a personalized library.

## ✨ Key Features  
- 💥 **Splash Screen**: An inviting introduction displaying the app’s logo.
- 🏠 **Home Screen**: Browse curated book recommendations.
- 📖 **Book Details Screen**: View detailed information for selected books.
- 🔍 **Search Screen**: Quickly find books by title, author, or genre.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
